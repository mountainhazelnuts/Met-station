Safely remove SD card, put into Raspberry Pi and power on. 

Login locally (using keyboard and monitor) or over SSH (user:weewx - password:none)

    # Altitude of the station, with unit it is in. 
    altitude = 100, meter    # Choose 'foot' or 'meter' for unit

Save and exit (Ctrl-X) -> 'Y'

Restart weewx service:
sudo service weewx restart

Set harware clock to correct time
Connect Rpi to internet by connecting router WAN to Office LAN

Check date / time is correct:
sudo service ntp restart
date

Should show correct date / time

Write time to hardware clock:
sudo hwclock -w
check
sudo hwclock -r
